# How to submit your own fan art?

Do you have awesome World of Turtle fan art to submit?
You have a chance to showcase your own artwork within World of Turtle.
During the game's loading screen, and within the fan art gallery in the menu, we display art made by fans.
To share your art, do the following:
- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/jacklehamster/dynamic-data).
- Upload your image, preferably < 200kb jpg, in the ["dok-game/loading" folder](https://github.com/jacklehamster/dynamic-data/tree/main/dok-game/loading).
- Make sure to title your file the way you'd like the label to be displayed. Ex: "MyBeautifulArtwork_by_AuthorName.jpg".
- *Note*: Your art must include the word "Loading" in it, and must not contain any offensive material.
- Push your change in your own repo.
- Submit a merge request into the [jacklehamster/dynamic-data repo](https://github.com/jacklehamster/dynamic-data).

We will review your fan art and merge if we find it appropriate. If not, we'll comment on the pull request to let you know if there's any change needed.
